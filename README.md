# Red Hat OpenShift Cluster on VPC

This template creates a Red Hat OpenShift cluster with the Public Service Endpoint disabled on an existing VPC. To create this cluster, a COS instance is created for cluster storage, and a Key Protect instance is created for encryption. This template creates a VSI to create an NLB Proxy for cluster access.

To create a VPC for your cluster, use the [Multizone VPC Gen2 Asset](https://github.com/Cloud-Schematics/multizone-vpc-gen2)

*Note: this template assumes that the VSI created will have access to the public internet*

## Resources

This module creates an IBM Cloud Object Stroage instance required for the creation of an OpenShift cluster. This module also creates a Key Protect instance and a Key Protect Root Key to encrypt the cluster. To ensure that the COS instance has access to the cluster, an authorization policy is created to allow the Key Protect instance to read from the COS instance.

These resources can be found in the [./resources](./resources) module.

---

## Cluster

This module creates a Red Hat OpenShift cluster across any number of existing subnets on an existing VPC.

The cluster is created in [cluster.tf](./cluster.tf)

---

## Worker Pools (Optional)

This module can optionally create any number of worker pools across the same subnets where the cluster is created. 

The worker pools are created in [./worker_pools](./worker_pools)

---

## Virtual Server and NLB Proxy

This template creates a single VSI to create an NLB Proxy to allow access to the cluster via the Private Service Endpoint. To read more about accessing the cluster through a private service endpoint refer to the [documentation here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_cluster#access_private_se).

The virtual server by default uses the [install_terraform_vsi](./scripts/install_terraform_vsi.sh) script to install terraform, write the script inside the VSI, and run the script.

In addition, the IBM Cloud CLI, kubectl CLI, and OpenShift CLI are installed inside the VSI to test connectivity.

The VSI is created in [nlb_proxy_via_vsi.tf](./nlb_proxy_via_vsi.tf)
